# Bank System Network - (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a complete network infrastructure for Meezan Bank Ltd. in Islamabad, Pakistan. The network ensures efficient banking and insurance services by integrating VLANs, DHCP, SSH, OSPF, and essential servers such as HTTP and Email. 

## Features & Implementation
The project is implemented using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, a network simulation tool that enables the visualization and testing of complex network topologies. The following key features are included:

### ðŸ”¹ **Network Design & Security**
- **Hierarchical Network Design**: Ensuring scalability and performance.
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Each department has a separate VLAN for security and traffic management.
- **IP Addressing & Subnetting**: Efficient allocation of IP addresses based on departmental needs.
- **Dynamic IP Allocation**: DHCP servers assign IPs dynamically for seamless network management.
- **Secure Remote Access**: SSH configured for secure remote login to all routers.
- **Routing Protocol**: OSPF implemented for efficient data transmission.
- **Port-Security**: Switches configured with security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Wireless Network**: Wi-Fi access points for wireless users across departments.

### ðŸ”¹ **Server Configurations**
- **Email & HTTP Servers**: Configured for communication and essential banking functions.
- **Testing & Verification**: Extensive network testing to ensure security, communication, and reliability.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Subnet Calculator
- Network Security Protocols

## Installation & Usage
1. Download **Cisco Packet Tracer** if not installed.
2. Open the `.pkt` file in Packet Tracer.
3. Analyze network topology, configurations, and simulate network behavior.

## Screenshots & Demonstrations
(Add network diagrams or screenshots of your implementation here.)

## Future Improvements
- Implement real-world network configurations using actual Cisco devices.
- Add VPN for enhanced security in remote banking operations.
